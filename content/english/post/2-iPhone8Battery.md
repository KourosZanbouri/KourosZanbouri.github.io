With determination and a DIY spirit, I embarked on the journey of repairing my beloved iPhone 8. Its battery had served me faithfully for years, but it had finally reached its end, forcing me to charge it every few hours. After exploring various repair options around the city, I was disheartened by the high fees demanded by professionals, which didn't seem worth it for an older phone model.

Fueled by the desire to give my iPhone 8 a second life, I decided to take matters into my own hands and ordered a battery replacement kit from [iFixit](https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/iphone-8-replacement-battery), which also came with the necessary tools. I was optimistic that I could handle the repair process myself, but my enthusiasm was met with a challenge.

The problem arose when I tried to open the screws at the bottom of the phone. They seemed to be loose, simply rotating in place without coming out. I tried various techniques from the repair kit, but none of them worked. Frustration threatened to dampen my resolve.

Then, a simple but ingenious idea struck me â€“ the trusty wooden toothpick and some superglue. I carefully placed a drop of superglue on a piece of paper and delicately stuck the wooden toothpick into the drop. With precision, I then inserted the glued end of the toothpick into the stubborn screws, allowing the glue to work its magic for a minute.

When the moment of truth arrived, I gently pulled the toothpick, and to my relief, the screws began to yield. They finally came out, making way for me to proceed with the battery replacement. I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that I had overcome this obstacle using a simple and innovative solution.
